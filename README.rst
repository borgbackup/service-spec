Borg Backup Service Specification (Work in Progress!)
=====================================================

This specification is about defining how a conforming backup service using
borgbackup looks like from the outside.

It is intended for service providers (big or small, private or public,
commercial or non-commercial).

Setting up in a standard way has some advantages:

- enables switching service providers rather easily
- services can be set up in a proven, secure, reviewed way
- changes / improvements of the setup are done in new spec releases
- no need to reinvent the wheel
